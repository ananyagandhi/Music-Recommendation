This project utilizes Logistic Regression, SVMs, and Boosting techniques to generate song recommendations given a user's preferences. The project also incorporates lyrics based music recommendation, by scraping the lyrics to the songs in the dataset, and using a cosine similarity function to generate recommendations. Using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT, the lyrics are vectorized and then compared with the lyrics vectors corresponding to the user's liked and disliked songs in order to generate recommendations.
